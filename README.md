# Week1 Horiseon
 ## Week 1 Challenge - Refactoring Horiseon Website
 This week we were asked to "refact" a website - a common job for junior web developers, involving meeting a clients needs while employing up to date methods and current best practice. You should always leave the code cleaner than you found it. \
 
 This particular client wants their website to be up to standard in terms of accessibility in order to bolster their web presence with search engine optimisation. \

 ## This Involved:
 1. Compressing .img files to be a suitable size for users in areas with limited/restrictive internet access
 2. Providing "alt" descriptions to .img files
 3. Making sure all links are functioning
 4. Using semantic HTML
